<h1 align="center">Meowix Linux</h1>

<p align="center">An Arch Linux based distribution centered around the Catppuccin theme</p>

## What's Meowix?

Meowix Linux is an [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)-based distribution that heavily utilizes Catppuccin. From the official [Catppuccin GitHub repository](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin)'s README:

> Catppuccin is a community-driven pastel theme that aims to be the middle ground between low and high contrast themes.

In particular, Meowix Linux uses the Mocha flavor of Catppuccin.

Meowix also uses the highly configurable [BSPWM](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm).

Meowix Linux aims to make the installation of a beautiful and efficient system easier than ever before!

## How can I install Meowix?

Please follow the guide linked [here](https://github.com/Meowix-Linux/Meowix-ISO/#installation) in order to install Meowix Linux on your machine. Please note, **we are in early development** and you may experience some issues, which we encourage you to [report](https://github.com/Meowix-Linux/Meowix-ISO/issues).

## Who develops Meowix?

Meowix is a labor of love, primarily developed by [Nekosis](https://github.com/Nekosis), with contributions from dedicated friends. While we don't accept monetary donations, you can support us by spreading the word and recommending Meowix to others. Your enthusiasm is our greatest reward.

## What is Meowix licensed under?

Most repositories and projects under the Meowix name are licensed under the [GPLv3 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). The Catppuccin theme is licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/). Licenses for other software included in the distribution are usually found within the files provided by their respective packages.

## Does Meowix use the Contributor Covenant?

As you know by now, Meowix Linux heavily utilizes the Catppuccin theme for GTK, Qt, and standalone apps. Catppuccin is a project that uses the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://github.com/catppuccin/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). **However,** unlike Catppuccin, we do not wish to use this code of conduct at this time. While it is an admirable action to add a code of conduct to your project, we find that the Contributor Covenant is too vague and subjective, and we also have concerns over the views of its creator. We are not saying not to use the Contributor Covenant; you are free to do so in whatever project you like. However, do not expect Meowix Linux to begin use of the Contributor Covenant or any other code of conduct any time soon.

## I need to get in contact regarding a legal issue.

If you have found that Meowix has violated any licenses or copyrights, please don't hesitate to open an issue on the repository/repositories that do so and we will do our best to respond in a timely manner.
